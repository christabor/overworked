                    <h4>What is productivity?</h4>
                    <p>In America, a capitalist utopia, the charter for corporations, the lifeblood of this utopia, states that the bottom line (the cash flow of a company) MUST come before anything else. You can rally for or against this rule, or argue that it’s just an ideology more than anything, but the fact is, a CEO can be voted out by shareholders if he fails to uphold this unsustainable rule. Dogma aside, it is highly enforceable, and legal too.</p>
                    <p>This mentality trickles down and permeates all employees, creating a general “fog of war”. If a corporation is by nature capitalist, thus taking no prisoners, and its employees are all held to the standard of the bottom line and little (if anything) else, then what you’ve created is a machine that is out to destroy all competition, by any means necessary.</p>
                    <p>And this is exactly what you see. Very little cooperation amongst companies, incessant meddling to drive up stock prices, consumer demand that fluctuates violently, all held sway by the markets and media.</p>

                        Guard Labor: Guard Labor is the Labor of protection. Protecting people, assets, business and more, it focuses on guarding what already exists. Labor of this type is necessary in small doses, but as an upward trend, it should concern everyone that this field has been growing by leaps and bounds. It signifies a trend that wealth is being accumulated and needs to be protected, a warning sign for any democracy.

                    <p>
                        The modus operandi for most large companies in America flies in the face of sustainable growth. It is absolutely vital to maintain a symbiotic relationship with the natural resources available, yet corporations seek to circumvent this system, or disregard it altogether. It is a pyrrhic victory for everyone involved, because it means destroying the lifeblood for our
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often times, the bottom line of a company trumps sustainability. Little incentives have been given to subsidize good practices, and it is compounded by the rat race mentality, inviting waste and overconsumption.

                    <h4>Unsustainable Capitalism</h4>
                    <p>
                        In America, a capitalist utopia, the charter for corporations, the lifeblood of this utopia, states that the bottom line (the cash flow of a company) MUST come before anything else. You can rally for or against this rule, or argue that it’s just an ideology more than anything, but the fact is, a CEO can be voted out by shareholders if he fails to uphold this unsustainable rule. Dogma aside, it is highly enforceable, and legal too.
                        This mentality trickles down and permeates all employees, creating a general “fog of war”. If a corporation is by nature capitalist, thus taking no prisoners, and its employees are all held to the standard of the bottom line and little (if anything) else, then what you’ve created is a machine that is out to destroy all competition, by any means necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And this is exactly what you see. Very little cooperation amongst companies, incessant meddling to drive up stock prices, consumer demand that fluctuates violently, all held sway by the markets and media.
                        Here are some of the many negative effects of this model:
                        Patent laws that destroy innovation and flood the legal system with cases.
                        Constant risk of antitrust, as corporations consume smaller companies in an effort to dominate a given market.

                <h3>Technology as Shackle?</h3>
                <p>
                    If we were to measure society based solely on its relationship with technology, it would become clear that we are slaves to the technology as much as it is to us. From long days staring at a screen, to long nights working after-hours, we are constantly revolving around some sort of electronic input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Increased hours, increased daycare, decreased stimulation, decreased educational performance, lower income jobs, all translate into poorer quality of life and decreased output. The general reaction to this decrease in output is to ratchet up the work time, so that more work can get done. But it only serves to exacerbate the problem, until eventually the workplace breaks down completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other questions not many seem to consider are the morals of our actions. It’s one thing to teach children the importance of hard work, but what kind of values are we actually teaching our kids?
                    Do we want them to grow up and see the world as simply a rat race? The economics of work are often opposed to the morals of work. Work is supposed to imply something good and useful, but is more often than not twisted into something more perverse.

            <h4>Deciding our fate</h4>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the question must be asked: what kind of country do we want to be? A country of caring, compassionate citizens, or those that are obsessed with the “rat-race”? The former is pragmatic, while the latter is short-sighted. A wise culture knows the right choice is compassion.
